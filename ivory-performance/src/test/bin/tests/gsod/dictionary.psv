gsod:stn|encoding=int|description=Station number (WMO/DATSAV3 number) for the location.
gsod:wban|encoding=int|description=WBAN number where applicable--this is the historical "Weather Bureau Air Force Navy" number - with WBAN being the acronym.
gsod:temp|encoding=double|tombstone=9999.9|description=Mean temperature for the day in degrees Fahrenheit to tenths.
gsod:dewp|encoding=double|tombstone=9999.9|description=Mean dew point for the day in degrees Fahrenheit to tenths.
gsod:slp|encoding=double|tombstone=9999.9|description=Mean sea level pressure for the day in millibars to tenths.
gsod:stp|encoding=double|tombstone=9999.9|description=Mean station pressure for the day in millibars to tenths.
gsod:visib|encoding=double|tombstone=999.9|description=Mean visibility for the day in miles to tenths.
gsod:wdsp|encoding=double|tombstone=999.9|description=Mean wind speed for the day in knots to tenths.
gsod:mxspd|encoding=double|tombstone=999.9|description=Maximum sustained wind speed reported for the day in knots to tenths.
gsod:gust|encoding=double|tombstone=999.9|description=Maximum wind gust reported for the day in knots to tenths.
gsod:max|encoding=double|tombstone=9999.9|description=Maximum temperature reported during the day in Fahrenheit to tenths--time of max temp report varies by country and region, so this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day.
gsod:min|encoding=double|tombstone=9999.9|description=Minimum temperature reported during the day in Fahrenheit to tenths--time of min temp report varies by country and region, so this will sometimes not be the min for the calendar day.
gsod:prcp|encoding=double|tombstone=99.9|description=Total precipitation (rain and/or melted snow) reported during the day in inches and hundredths; will usually not end  with the midnight observation--i.e.,  may include latter part of previous day. .00 indicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace). Missing = 99.99 Note:  Many stations do not report '0' on days with no precipitation--therefore, '99.99' will often appear on these days. Also, for example, a station may only report a 6-hour amount for the period during which rain fell. See Flag field for source of data.
gsod:prcp_flag|encoding=string|type=categorical|description=A 1 report of 6-hour precipitation amount. B = Summation of 2 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount. C = Summation of 3 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount. D = Summation of 4 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount. E = 1 report of 12-hour precipitation amount. F = Summation of 2 reports of 12-hour precipitation amount. G = 1 report of 24-hour precipitation amount. H = Station reported '0' as the amount for the day (eg, from 6-hour reports), but also reported at least one occurrence of precipitation in hourly observations--this could indicate a trace occurred, but should be considered as incomplete data for the day. I = Station did not report any precip data for the day and did not report any occurrences of precipitation in its hourly observations--it's still possible that precip occurred but was not reported.
gsod:sndp|encoding=double|description=Snow depth in inches to tenths--last report for the day if reported more than once.
