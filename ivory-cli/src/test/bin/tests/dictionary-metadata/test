# NOTE: This test has an unfortunate chicken/egg problem in that new metadata versions will break here
# The recommended approach (for now) is to ignore this broken test in cli (assuming it is the only failures) and then
# upgrade $IVORY_BASELINE in master straight afterwards (you need to wait until Ivory builds/publishes).
