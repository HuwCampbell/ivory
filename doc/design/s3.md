s3/emr support for ivory
========================

### Goal

Support a usage of ivory where S3 is used as a file system for an
ivory repository where any processing (ingest, extract, validate) can
be done vie ephemeral EMR clusters.

### Constraints

This must be done in a way that is somewhat efficient, the consequence
of this is that it may preclude directly reading and writing to S3 and
instead using hdfs + distcp to perform operations on the cluster and
sync back.
