  /**
   * Currently we don't have any size information for namespaces, so the best we can do is look at the window "size"
   * and assume it's proportional to the data size (which isn't necessarily true).
   *
   * For features without windows they continue to be partitioned evenly.
   * For features with windows the number of (total) reducers is divided again by the proportion of window size.
   *
   * The implications on the following is such:
   * - Features without windows will _always_ be `1`
   * - Features with windows will add up to the total number (regardless of the non-window features)
   *
   * {{{
   *   Total no. of reducers = 5
   *   Feature -> No. of reducers
   *   fid0: no window -> 1
   *   fid1: no window -> 1
   *   fid2: no window -> 1
   *   ...
   *   --------------------
   *   fidX: 4 months  -> 2
   *   fidY: 8 months  -> 3
   * }}}
   *
   * This could lead to the following case, where a single windowed feature is divided/shared across all of the reducers.
   *
   * {{{
   *   Total no. of reducers = 5
   *   Feature -> No. of reducers
   *   fid0: no window -> 1
   *   fid1: no window -> 1
   *   fid2: no window -> 1
   *   ....
   *   --------------------
   *   fidX: 1 month   -> 5
   * }}}
